# Educational System
In this project we will build a website only for SUT course registration handling.

## Code Style
We will try to use [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) coding style for this project.

## Frontend
As the frontend framework, we will use two libraries:
1. [Pure-css](https://purecss.io): We will use [React-Pure](http://hailocab.github.io/react-pure/) as the base framework for the minimal style of the website. Because we want to make our custom elements in most cases.
2. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com): We will use [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/components/navbar/) for the more complex items that will take time to design.
