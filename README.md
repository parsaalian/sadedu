[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/ecd52e685dfb45a69cc418dedac39c0f)](https://www.codacy.com?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=parsaalian/sadedu&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)
In this project we will build a website only for SUT course registration handling.

## Code Style
We will try to use [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) coding style for this project.

## Frontend
As the frontend framework, we will use two libraries:
1. [Pure-css](https://purecss.io): We will use [React-Pure](http://hailocab.github.io/react-pure/) as the base framework for the minimal style of the website. Because we want to make our custom elements in most cases.
2. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com): We will use [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/navbar/) for the more complex items that will take time to design.
